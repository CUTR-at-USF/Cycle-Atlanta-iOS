#CycleAtanta

## Introduction
Cycle Atlanta is a smartphone app for recording your bicycle trips. When you use the app, you are giving transportation planners with the City of Atlanta the data they need to make Atlanta a better place to ride.
The  app is based on the CycleTracks app originally developed for the San Francisco Country Transportation Authority.

## Partners
Cycle Atlanta is a joint project between the City of Atlanta Department of Planning & Community Development, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Bicycle Coalition and Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). It is funded through a contribution from the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition and the Atlanta Regional Commission's Livable Centers Initiative planning program. Additional support is provided by the GVU Center and the Institute for People and Technology at Georgia Tech.
